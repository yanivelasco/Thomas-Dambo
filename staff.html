        <h2> The Artist</h2>
        <p>Before embarking on the path of building larger than life sculptures, Thomas lived a diverse life with a multifaceted resume: human beatbox, graffiti/street artist, and rapper to name a few.<br>

            Thomas enrolled at the internationally acclaimed Kolding Design School where he earned a masterâ€™s degree in interactive design. It was then that he recalled the values his parentsinstilled, using free and recycled materials to build thousands of colorful birdhouses that adorned the streets of Denmark.<br>
            
            His limitless imagination and resourcefulness have created the foundation for his artwork today.
